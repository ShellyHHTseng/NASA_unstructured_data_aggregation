# NASA_unstructured_data_aggregation
Hi there, 
 
 The python file attached here can be used to aggregate the unstructured data of the NASA A-Train satellite observation data. The goal of this script is collocating and aggregating multiple spaceborne satellite observations, and the output can be used as the input of the radiative transfer model (the zip-files) to evaluate the global cloud radiative effect.
 
Have fun : )
